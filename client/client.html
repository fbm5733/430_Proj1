    <h3>The data is formatted to work with the PokeAPI's data, as the project will be a teambuilder.<br/> 
      Currently this data isn't set up, but my own API still has functinality of its own.<br/>
      The functionality here is just to show what I've done so far with my API, not at all final.<br/>
